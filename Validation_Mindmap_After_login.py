    Generate a valid FreeMind (.mm) XML file that represents a complete website structure.

    ✅ Requirements:
    1. The first node must be "Home Page".
    2. The "Home Page" must contain three subnodes:
    - Header
    - Main Content
    - Footer
    3. The "Header" and "Footer" should appear only once, under the Home Page. The content inside them should not include in any other page.
    4. Every other page (e.g.,Search, About, Contact, etc.) must be direct subnodes of the header.
    5. Each page node must include all its UI elements (buttons, forms, links, and content) as nested subnodes.
    6. If any page contains subpages, represent them as child nodes under that page.
    7. Maintain a clear hierarchical structure that accurately reflects parent-child relationships between pages and their components.
    9. Ensure all nodes are properly nested and the XML is valid.
    10. Use hyperlinks (LINK attribute) for nodes that represent pages, linking to their respective URLs.
    11.Properly escape XML entities (`& → &amp;`, `< → &lt;`, `>` → &gt;`). 
    The output must be a well-formed .mm (FreeMind) XML mindmap file without any extra commentary.

    Your job:
    - Validate that the .mm structure matches the specified hierarchy and requirements.
    - Ensure the file includes all expected nodes, subnodes, buttons, links, and forms.
    - Fix any missing or misplaced elements while preserving valid XML formatting.
